# Arcade Classics Collection
UniSG Programming Group Project

**Overview**

The Mini Arcade Games Collection is a project that brings together a variety of classic games that many of us enjoyed during our childhood. The collection includes Hangman, Snake, Minesweeper, and Memory Puzzle. These games not only offer nostalgic fun but also provide a simple yet engaging way to practice coding with Pygame, a popular library for creating video games in Python.

**Inspiration**

This project was inspired by the fond memories we have of playing these games during our childhood. Whether it was during recess, after school, or on weekends, these games provided countless hours of entertainment and friendly competition. We wanted to recreate those experiences and bring them to a modern platform where we can relive those moments and share them with others. Our professor suggested that we include a README file to document our project, and we hope it captures the essence of our journey in creating this collection.

**Games Included**

1.	Hangman: Guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn. Choose from various themes such as Science, Sports, Geography, and Animals.
2.	Snake: Control the snake to eat the fruit and grow longer. Avoid colliding with the walls, obstacles, or yourself.
3.	Minesweeper: Uncover all the cells that don't contain mines. Don't land on the mines to avoid losing the game! And Flag all the cells you suspect have mines, once correctly identified, you win the game!
4.	Memory Puzzle: Match pairs of cards by flipping them over. Find all pairs before time runs out. Select from different themes like default, animals, and space.

**Features**

- Multiple classic games in one collection. 
- User-friendly interface with simple controls. 
- Theme selection for Hangman and Memory Puzzle games. 
- Dynamic difficulty levels for Snake and Memory Puzzle. 
- Game over screens with options to restart, quit, or return to the main menu.
- Nostalgic design and gameplay to bring back childhood memories.

**How to Run the Project**

1.	Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from python.org.


2.	Install Pygame: Install the Pygame library using pip, Pythonâ€™s package installer. Open your command prompt or terminal and run:

pip install pygame

4. Download the Code: Download or clone the repository containing the Arcade Classics Collection and their corresponding game folder.


5.	Navigate in your terminal to the Project Directory and use this command to change directories.

cd //"<YOURPATH>"/arcade_classics_collection

7.	Run the Code "arcade_classics_collection.py" to start the game collection

python3 arcade_classics_collection.py
"YourPythonVersion"

6. Enjoy the Games: The main menu will appear with options to play Hangman, Snake, Minesweeper, or Memory Puzzle. Click on the game you want to play and start enjoying!
Controls
- Hangman: Use the mouse to click on letters to make guesses.
